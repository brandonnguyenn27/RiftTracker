how to use:

required: get riot dev api key - free api key but refreshes every 24 hours
https://developer.riotgames.com/

1. clone repo
2. create .env file in /server directory
3. declare API_KEY value with your Riot API Key
   ex. API_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
4. cd into server and client directory in terminal, npm run dev on both
5. search up riot player name + their tagline
   ex. playerName#NA1
6. If search button doesn't work at first just refresh (will be fixed eventually)
